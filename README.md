# BuildYourOwnAdventure
This application was created during my Senior Capstone project at UNC Charlotte. My partners were Aaron Farmer, Brandon Cozart, Kareem Osman, Jessica Cochran, and John Lair. This project is an Android Application built using the Android Studio IDE, coded in Java, markup in XML, and Google Firebase Firestore was used for the NoSQL database.
